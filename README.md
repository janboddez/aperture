# F-Stop
F-Stop is an experimental fork of [Aperture](https://aperture.p3k.io), a [Microsub](https://indieweb.org/Microsub) server.

## Features
The following are what currently makes F-Stop different from Aperture:
- An attempt at improved keyboard navigation, i.e., within the different settings modals
- OPML import and export; export and import your entire feed list to other feed aggregators
- Additional source settings (like a site URL)
- The ability to "fetch original content," i.e., fetch and parse complete entries, even for summary-only feeds
- A dynamically populated "Unread" channel, which groups all unread entries
- The ability to really easily move or copy sources between different channels

## Fetch Original Content
This feature can be enabled on a per-source basis, or triggered manually, in clients that support it, for specific posts. It supports XPath queries.
